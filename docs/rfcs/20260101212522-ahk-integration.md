# RFC: AutoHotkey v2 Integration

Integrate the `remove-newline-util` with AutoHotkey v2 to provide a seamless "Copy -> Process -> Paste" workflow.

## Staging

The integration uses the `remove-newline.ahk` script from the [Kardenwort AutoHotkey repository](https://github.com/voothi/20240411110510-autohotkey).

## Implementation Details

### Analytics & Decisions
- **Execution Method**: The AHK script is configured to run the Python script directly using `RunWait`. This ensures that the clipboard is only updated after the Python script has finished processing.
- **Workflow Automation**:
  - **Step 1**: `Send("^c")` and `ClipWait(1)` to reliably copy the selected text.
  - **Step 2**: `RunWait` with the `Hide` option to execute the Python script invisibly.
  - **Step 3**: `Send("^v")` to paste the cleaned text back immediately.
- **Python Path**: Acknowledged that users must update the Python interpreter path and the script path in their local AHK configuration.
- **Standalone Mode**: The utility remains functional as a standalone executable for manual triggers, but the AHK integration is the recommended path for high-efficiency workflows.
