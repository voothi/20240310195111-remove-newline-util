# RFC: Release v1.0.0

Prepare documentation for v1.0.0.

## Staging

The release version is v1.0.0.

## Implementation Details

### Analytics & Decisions
- **Clipboard Integration**: The tool is designed to work as a background utility that monitors and modifies the clipboard content upon execution. This approach minimizes user interaction and streamlines the cleaning process.
- **Cleaning Logic**:
  - **Hyphenation**: Specifically targets word breaks like `betre-\n ten` to ensure words are rejoined correctly.
  - **HTML Cleaning**: Removes common HTML tags and entities often picked up during copying from web sources or OCR.
  - **Whitespace Normalization**: Collapses multiple spaces and removes spaces before punctuation to ensure clean, readable text.
- **Packaging**: The tool is distributed as a standalone executable (using PyInstaller) to ensure ease of use on systems without a Python environment.
- **Version Numbering**: Starting with v1.0.0 as the first stable release ready for general use.
